# Features {#concept_izx_ktm_1gb .concept}

ID Verification supports face anti-spoofing, OCR, real-name verification, and facial recognition.

## Face anti-spoofing {#section_az0_thr_2ma .section}

This feature requires the user to take a live video or photo to prove that the operation is performed by the user in person. This protects you against attacks that use your photos, videos, and 3D-simulated masks.

When you take a live video, make movements according to the instructions, for example, stare at the camera, open your mouth, shake your head, and blink your eyes. The system then automatically collects your facial information from the video and checks whether you have made movements as required and determines whether it is an attack.

## OCR {#section_3h3_naq_6ls .section}

This feature requires you to submit a scanned copy of the front and back sides of your identity document. The system then uses the OCR technology to automatically recognize and read the information, including your name, document number, and validity date. The collected information is displayed for you to confirm. The accuracy of this technology is over 99%. With this feature, you don't need to manually enter information, which improves user experience.

## Real-name verification {#section_sz5_6li_uer .section}

This feature verifies the authenticity of your name and ID card number, and checks whether the name and the ID card number match. This prevents identity fraud.

**Note:** This feature is intended for countries and regions that have an authenticated resident information database, for example, Mainland China.

## Facial recognition {#section_ye9_e7s_a33 .section}

This feature uses the cutting-edge facial recognition technology to compare the photo taken on site with the one on the identity document. If an authenticated database provides a profile photo, ID Verification can also compare the photo with the profile photo to verify the identity of the person.
